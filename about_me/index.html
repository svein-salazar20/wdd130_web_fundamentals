    <p>Hey there! My name is Eduardo, but I prefer my middle name, Svein, I'm from Hidalgo Mexico, I'm 21 years old, I'm about to be 22 the 26th of April.</p>
    <p>I'm working to get my Web &  Computer Programming degree, I've just finished Pathway Connect so this is my first semester and I'm so excited to reach such an important goal such higher education. there are so many things I enjoy, like spending time with my family and my girlfriend, puzzle-solving, running, listening to music, and reading.</p>

    <p>I'm currently working from home for a call center called Results, what I do is provide a high quality customer service to The Home Depot clients, this is helping me pursue my goal of getting married and get higher education.</p>
    <p>I think that learning about careers in web desing and programming is great because is something that people and compainies, bussiness, industries, schools, etc are looking for, bacuse there are so much information over the internet and they want to be present in here. these topics are so enjoyable for me, I think I have chosen a good career, the one for me.</p>
    <p>I have been member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints since I'm 8, my favorite teach of our beloved Profet Russel M. Nelson is that aour happines has everything to do with our perspective and, nothing to do with our circumstances. My favorite scripture is in the book of Mormon, in Mosiah 2: 41 "And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are recieved into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it."</p>
